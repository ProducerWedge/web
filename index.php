            <h1>Welcome to the Neighborhood</h1>
            <p class="author">Stories by Rick Mace</p>
          <h1>Lawnmower</h1>
            <p>The day began by being torn from my sleep by the sound of my neighbor’s Ferris IS6200 Zero Turn Mower. His name was Frank, he’s what some called an eccentric lunatic. He enjoyed the smell of a Camellia Japonica at dawn and a French machine gun being fired in pitch dark. A large man, with a beard consisting of splintered grey and black hairs, bifocals and always adorned in a bolo tie. The tie had a centerpiece that contained a small compartment that held his middle finger’s distal phalanx, or tip. He lost it in a bowling accident during a late-night high-stakes tournament with the Lucky Strikes, a team of four delinquents that were known to put super glue in their opponent's bowling ball sockets. When Frank bowled the last frame for the win the tip of his middle finger was ripped off as the ball continued down the lane for a strike and the win. Later that night he distinguished his lit lucky strike cigarette in the eye socket of the leader of the Strikes for payback and the actual win.</p>
            <p> A riding lawnmower was overkill due to Frank’s yard being the size of a diorama of a real suburban yard. The first-day inauguration of his mower, three weeks ago, had consisted of him running over a sprinkler head and ripping out a large section of his sprinkler system as it became lodged under the frame. In the confusion, he plummeted off the curb and continued down his cul-de-sac dragging his sprinkler system with him. When he turned back to see the damage, he tumbled off his mower. He hit with a loud thud as his zero-turn aimlessly rolled to the curb and stopped. He laid on his back feeling the warmness of the concrete and stared into the cold blue sky as his past failures and misfortunes flowed abruptly through him. He clutched the end of his bolo tie for strength and angrily pulled himself up.</p>
            <p>Frank was my friend. We were more different than alike. He was the down to my up. I was the shallow comment to his deep thoughts. We met on the highway in a road rage event. I had cut him off without signaling. He had followed me for twenty miles firing chrome-plated ball bearings at my car with his Pro X Slingshot. I finally got tired and just pulled over. We pounded, thrashed, and thumped each other until we grew to like one another. Shaking hands, I realized he was my neighbor.</p>
          <p>I looked out the window to see the mower abruptly stop. Frank angrily banged on the handles. He continued to hit the starter to no avail. I wiped my eyes, grabbed some clothes, and went out to help. As I walked across the street a woman, who appeared to be inside out from her lack of fashion sense, ate a pinwheel sandwich as her Neapolitan Mastiff dropped a load in an unsuspecting yard. She smiled, took another large bite, and then kicked it into the street like Messi kicking a winning goal. I watched her walk away as I entered Frank’s yard.</p>
          <p>“Franko, how it goes?” He looked up, “What doesn’t kill you, makes you wish it did!” I looked at the mower as if I might know what was wrong before speaking.
          “Check the sparkplug?”
          “Not yet. How do you check it?”</p>
          <p>
            I had no idea but couldn’t resist. “It’s a strange method but I saw it on YouTube and read about it in Modern Mechanics. Not sure if you want to do it.”
                      He angrily replied, “Get on with it! What do you do?”
            “One person hits the starter while the other urinates on the sparkplug. If you see blue smoke the sparkplug is good, red it’s bad.”
            “Screw you. I’m not trying that. I bet it’s the fuel filter.”
            “Maybe, it’s up to you,” I said as if not caring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frank looked around the yard in hopes of a better idea. Finding none he spoke, “I’ll hit the starter. You do the honors.”
            “I’m colored blind, you’ll have to do it.”
            “Colored blind, what does that have to do with it?”
            “I can’t see the color of the smoke and you can’t see it from where you are sitting.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He indignantly pulled himself off the mower. We passed each other as I climbed on the seat, and he removed the sparkplug cap. He looked around the neighborhood before unzipping. Frank let it go. I hit the starter. The electric current crackled and popped as it quickly flowed upstream like a run of salmon on their way upriver. The sodium and uric acid delivered the unwanted parcel of electricity quickly and succinctly like an overzealous FedEx driver. The explosive punch to the crotch caused him to scream three octaves higher than normal in pain. He began rolling around the yard. “Tuck and roll. Tuck and roll,” I yelled as the aroma of burning flesh filled our noses.
            I knew my only hope was to run. I leapt off the mower and ran for my house. He followed in a serpentine pattern as he gathered his equilibrium. I ran into my house and slammed the door behind me. Frank rode the closed door into the front hallway as it was ripped from its hinges.
          </p>
          <p>
            We entered the kitchen and as we passed through the dining room my mother-in-law, late seventies, blueish grey hair, and an overall appearance of sternness looked up from her tea. My two kids and wife sat at the dining room table in front of their full plates looking on in bewilderment.
            “Sit!” She yelled.
          </p>
          <p>
            We abruptly stopped in our tracks. I reluctantly grabbed a chair next to my son. My wife stood as she spoke, “Hi Frank. Take mine.” She motioned to her plate. Frank sat. We stared at each other from across the table. We were once more kids in trouble. It felt good to be young again!
          </p>
          <p>
            Frank leaned back as he spoke, “Could I get some bacon bits for my mashed potatoes?” We began eating. After fifteen minutes we were friends again. It seems all differences disappear on a full stomach.

        <h1>Runaway Monkey</h1>
          <p>Two weeks ago, a person moved into the house across the street from us in Steeplechase. She was from Peru and had worked for Cisco Systems as a software engineer. My wife and I went over one day to say hello and introduce ourselves. She seemed very pleasant and invited us in. We took a seat in the living room on a tan Herman Miller sectional couch. She sat across from us on a Magic Spun lounge chair in chocolate.</p>
          <p> As we made polite conversation, I could hear some noises coming from the kitchen. I wondered if that might be her husband. She snapped her fingers and the door to the kitchen flew open to reveal an enormous albino monkey. He was wearing a little yellow beanie that barely fit his huge oblong head and his razor-sharp fangs angrily protruded from its mouth. His pink eyes darted back and forth between my wife and me as if at any second, he would attack and maul us to death. He was carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and small glasses of velvet liqueur. I jumped back in fear as he released an ear-piercing whooping sound and angrily dropped the tray on an Arhaus Telluride coffee table in wood and was gone before I could take another breath.</p>
          <p>She smiled as she spoke, “I found him deep in the bowels of the Amazon jungle. Isn’t El Pedo wonderful?” I looked around. “Was this real”, I thought.  Had she hypnotized us with some kind of AI voodoo? Was I going to wake up under an overpass feeling like I had been probed by some overzealous aliens? She grabbed the small glass of liqueur as she spoke, “I taught him to do chores, cook, and help around the house.” The rest of the conversation was a blur, all I could think about was El Pedo.</p>
        <p>A week later it was a Thursday night, and I was taking the trash out to the street. I looked over to see the garage door to our new neighbor’s house coming up. The car backed out and when I looked in El Pedo was behind the wheel. He rolled the window down and held up a fifty-dollar bill and an empty box of Marlboro cigarettes. He motioned for me to come to the car. When I came closer, I heard the click of the car door unlock. He made a snapping sound with his hand and motioned once more with the money and empty box. I knew what he wanted. I shook my head no. He pulled out another fifty. I figured you only live once, so let’s go!</p>
        <p>
          El Pedo was a good driver. He sat in a Dora the Explorer booster seat and had a thin block of wood bungee corded to his right leg to reach the pedals. After picking up his smokes we drove through the dark burrows of Houston. He would point and click his teeth as he showed me places never seen or appreciated before now. I was seeing them in a new light a new point of view. Everything looked special because my driver or better yet, spiritual guide, was an albino monkey named El Pedo. I told him about my family as I handed him my phone to show him pictures of my wife and kids. He looked once and then threw it out the window. There was no turning back now, no safety belt or rip cord to pull.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we made our way down the two-nine-zero, we smoked Black Dragon cigars and drank banana-flavored rum until we were numb. El Pedo was heavy-footed and seemed to like to always keep the petal to the metal. Throttle juice flowed like a river bursting through a collapsing dam causing us to stay at a constant speed well over the limit. El Pedo also liked to tailgate and then bump the car in front of us.  Drivers would abruptly veer over and then come at us in rage. Their eyes would bulge from their faces when they looked over to see an albino monkey driving. I would politely give them a “Howdy Folks” wave as they swerved off the road and slammed on their brakes. We would laugh as if there was no tomorrow every time it happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          We continued into the darkness with profound anticipation and a keen awareness of what might happen next. El Pedo pulled a picture he had hidden under his fur and handed it to me. It was of another albino monkey standing next to the bronze Buc-ee’s Beaver statue. There was a large X across Buc-ee’s face. I looked over to see a tear in his eye. I knew at that moment the addle dysfunctional beaver had somehow stolen his love. The happiness then slowly turned to whispers of melancholy as we rolled the windows down and felt the cool breeze flow over us as Miles Davis’s Kinda Blue spilled from the speakers. We drove until dawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day I came outside of my house to see two police cars across the street. The neighbor was frantic, someone she believed had stolen her car. I knew at that moment that El Pedo was gone. I looked down to see a yellow beanie and a fresh pack of Marlboros at my feet. Goodbye my friend, I will miss you! Hang on a second, where’s my wallet?
